## Technologies used

- Angular
- SASS


## For improvement

- Error handling
  
  - This is one of the main features that is missing in the UI. Although we get the proper error messages from the backend, we are not displaying it in the UI
  
- Better design

  - Some UI designs could be implemented in a better way for consistency

## Learnings and Challenges

### Angular
  
  - I am mostly using React as my go to frontend framework (or library) so using angular is very challenging. It is more verbose and the way it implements things the angular way made it quote challenging to learn. However, I like how verbose it is since I get to catch bugs and errors early. 
  
  - Also I see it as a steep mountain at first but a very reliable framework afterwards. Once you get to know the best practice on how to use the angular built-in modules and services, your development will be way faster since you won't need to learn another way of implementing them (assuming angular don't change them). This is in contrast to React where implementation of services and modules are dictated by other libraries so implementation could vary depending on the library the application is using
  
  
### Use UI Component library

 - I believe using a component library for Angular could have sped up my development. 
 
 ### Learn more on interceptors and toastrs
 
  -  I had a chance to look up on them but I was not able to implement them yet. This could have solved the error handling features of the application
